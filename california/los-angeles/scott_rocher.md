# Scott Rocher
Lead Engineer, FamilyFinds - Santa Monica, CA

## 1. What are you working on right now?
My days (and often nights) are spent solving some surprisingly complicated engineering challenges at FamilyFinds. Most of these stem from the complexity of the e-commerce funnel, from sending millions of emails a month to selling thousands of daily deal vouchers a day.

I'm always working on side projects, mostly because they help keep me from burning out, and also allow me to build consumer experiences using the latest technology.

## 2. What companies/projects have your worked on in the past?
Throughout college I built websites, basically to pay for beer / food. After graduating, I landed a job at the [USC Institute for Creative Technologies](http://ict.usc.edu). They hired me to do video and audio production but I decided to start learning PHP and after awhile was building applications from scratch to teach soldiers about leadership. I worked there for three years.

Next was Yahoo!, specially working in their entertainment office in Santa Monica. I got a chance to build some amazing user experiences there, including Movie Showtimes & Tickets, Movie Photo Galleries, TV Blog, and a handful of branded websites for big sponsors. I made it through three rounds of layoffs unscathed and decided to do what anyone would do, leave and join a local startup.

FamilyFinds (originally called DailyD) was founded by Matt Coffin and Jake Winebaum and their first hires were product / engineering. I still work there, leading a small team of developers and maintaining a complex e-commerce platform used by 20+ employees and thousands of customers a day.


## 3. What are you most proud of? 
I'm proud that I never stop thinking of new and innovative ways that people can use the internet to change their lives. I've always got something up my sleeve.

## 4. What advice do you have for new developers
Make sure you do some kind of physical exercise / activity everyday. I'm an avid cyclist and I can tell on days that I don't ride, something just doesn't feel right. As a bonus, exercise can help you solve problems by providing you some quality time to think about things.

## Bonus: Answer your own question: What kind of bike do you have?
I've got two -- a 2010 Cannondale Six Carbon 6 (Red / Black) and a 1984 Centurion Elite (Teal / Pink).
